## Features
1. _Curriculum-Based Personalization_
Registr is tailored for every student and his/her individual program requirements. The course data for a particular program is sourced from the course offerings document that is shared with the students before every registration cycle.

2. _Quick Course Lookup_
Registr features a courses panel with relevant courses for the student. You can also search for a course with the courses panel, based on either course name, code or a core area. The courses are arranged in a hierarchical fashion with core areas. From within this area, the student can also add courses to the course wishlist .

3. _Real-time Multicourse Monitoring_
Registr allows you to monitor course statistics, capacity and waitlist occupancy for all courses within the wishlist, in real-time. It also offers quick actionable inferences for each course, based on the state of the fetched course data from OSCAR. You can also filter courses within the wishlist based on the determined inferences for every course. This enables you to focus on courses with a particular inference.

4. _Proactive Planning_
Registr with its ‘Pathways’ panel allows you to define a set of pathways well before registration day. Pathways are a set of courses that can be taken together, or fulfill certain depth/breadth requirements within the curriculum. They represent alternative final registration outcomes. In case a course gets fully registered, Registr suggests better pathways to the user based on the chances of getting a seat within all of the courses that the particular pathway contains. Each pathway also has its own visual progress tracking.
